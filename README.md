This code creates a Telegram bot using the Python python-telegram-bot library. The bot responds to the /start command and shows an inline button to join a community. When the button is pressed, the bot sends a message with a join link.

Key Components:
Imports:

os: Used to access environment variables (for securely storing the bot token).
telegram: Provides classes to work with the Telegram API (e.g., Update, InlineKeyboardButton, InlineKeyboardMarkup).
telegram.ext: Contains the main logic for handling commands and interactions (Application, CommandHandler, CallbackQueryHandler).
The start function:

This function is triggered when a user sends the /start command to the bot.
It creates an inline keyboard with a single button ("Join our community") that, when clicked, triggers the callback_data="join_link".
python
Copy code
keyboard = [
    [InlineKeyboardButton("Join our community", callback_data="join_link")]
]
reply_markup = InlineKeyboardMarkup(keyboard)
The message sent back to the user includes the button and a greeting.
The button function:

This function handles the button press.
It checks if the user clicked the button with callback_data="join_link". If so, it sends a message with a link to join the community.
python
Copy code
if query.data == "join_link":
    join_link = "https://t.me/DiwaliRewardsBot?start=5668614247"
    await query.edit_message_text(text=f"Join our community here: {join_link}")
The main function:

Token handling: Instead of hardcoding the bot's token, it's retrieved from an environment variable (os.getenv('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN')). This improves security.
Application setup: An Application instance is created using the token, and two handlers are added:
CommandHandler("/start", start): This calls the start function when /start is issued.
CallbackQueryHandler(button): This handles button presses.
Run the bot: The bot starts listening for updates via application.run_polling().
Security:

The bot's token is stored in an environment variable (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN), ensuring that itâ€™s not exposed directly in the code.
Flow of Execution:
The user types /start in the chat with the bot.
The bot responds with a greeting message and a button.
The user clicks the button, which triggers a callback.
The bot responds by editing the message to include a link to join the community.
